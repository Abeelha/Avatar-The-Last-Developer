            <p class="padding-">The World of Avatar, the Mortal World, or the Physical World is divided into multiple landmasses, islands, and seas with a unique physical geography, landmarks, climates, and demography. For most of its history, the world was divided into a multitude of states and cultures which coalesced into four independent nations: The Air Nomads, the Water Tribe, the Earth Kingdom, and the Fire Nation.</p>

            <p class="t-italic">"The four nations were influenced by their corresponding element and accordingly shaped their environment."</p>

            <p>The Air Nomads had four temples located in the north, south, east, and west of the Earth. There are two main Water Tribes, situated north and south of the Earth Kingdom, the most expansive and populated state in the world. The Earth Kingdom is by far the largest of the original Four Nations, and its geography varies widely from region to region. While there is often not a "hard-and-fast" division between these regions, certain areas are marked by geographic features that may not be common elsewhere. The Fire Nation is located in the west of the world and is an archipelago of volcanic islands. Each nation has a predominant season, and geography has a great influence on the customs and culture of each country</p>

                The Avatar, formed initially when <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Wan"><strong>Wan</strong></a> permanently fused with <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Raava"><strong>Raava</strong></a> during the <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Harmonic_Convergence"><strong>Harmonic Convergence</strong></a> of 9,829 BG, is the human embodiment of light and peace through the connection with the Avatar Spirit. As the only physical being with the ability to bend all four elements, it is considered the Avatar's duty to master the four bending arts and use that power to keep balance among the four nations of the world, as well as between mankind and spirits. <p>Upon death, the Avatar Spirit causes the Avatar to reincarnate into the next nation, dictated by the cyclic order: fire, air, water, and earth. Mirroring the order in which the first Avatar, Wan, learned the elements, this is also the traditional order in which any one incarnation is to master the elements, beginning with the bending art of the Avatar's birth nation. The reincarnation cycle can only be broken if the Avatar is killed while in the Avatar State, Raava is removed from the Avatar and destroyed, or the Avatar Spirit is compromised by a spiritual infection .</p>

                "The Avatar State is a defense mechanism, designed to empower you with the skills and knowledge of all the past Avatars. The glow is the combination of all your past lives, focusing their energy through your body. In the Avatar State, you are at your most powerful, but you are also at your most vulnerable. If you are killed in the Avatar State, the reincarnation cycle will be broken and the Avatar will cease to exist." <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Roku"><strong>-Avatar Roku</strong></a>
