        Airbending

        Airbending is the bending art used by the Air Nomads; the flying bison were the original airbenders. It concentrates on speed and evasion, forgoing a strong offense for a greater defense. Though apparently lacking fatal finishing moves, it is the most dynamic of all the bending arts. As the element of freedom, airbenders use their capability to bend unencumbered by the ground or any other environmental factors and use their own momentum as a weapon, evading attacks with astounding agility to tire their opponents out or building up massive inertia for explosive gusts of wind to make their counterattacks finishing moves. When resorting to physical confrontation, airbenders are able to harness the immense, intangible power of wind. Airbenders can use a flight technique by operating a glider and using the air to provide thrust and lift. Airbending's opposite is earthbending and the confrontational style that serves as its foundation. The sub-skills of airbending are flight and spiritual projection. Flight has only been achieved by two people in the entire history of airbending, namely Guru Laghima and Zaheer.[8] Airbending is the element of freedom, and its season is autumn.
